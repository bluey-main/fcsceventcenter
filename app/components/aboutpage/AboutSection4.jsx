            The Federal Public Service Commission was consequently established
            on the 1st of April, 1954 through a Provision under section 174 of
            Nigerian Order-in-Council (Constitution) of 1954. The order provided
            that the Governor-General might (either generally or specially and
            in whatever manner he thought fit) refer to the Commission,
          </p>

          <p>
            the appointment of any person to an Office in the Public Service of
            the Federation, or dismissal or disciplinary control of Officers in
            the Public Service of Federation, or any other matter which in his
            opinion, affected the Public Service of the Federation.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            This in essence gave the Commission the authority to cover all posts
            (established or unestablished) for which funds were provided in the
            Federal Annual Estimates. The Commission at this stage was only an
            advisory body whose key mandate was advising the Governor-General.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            The position changed in 1956 when an amendment to the enabling
            legislation gave the Commission the power to appoint, promote,
            transfer, second, dismiss or otherwise discipline Officers belonging
            to certain grades. The name was later changed from Federal Public
            Service Commission to Federal ssion.
